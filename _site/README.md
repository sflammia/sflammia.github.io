I'm a quantum information theorist working at the AWS Center for Quantum Computing and Caltech. 
My research interests are broad, and include quantum error correction, quantum fault tolerance, and learning and estimation for quantum systems, specifically quantum noise.

My papers can all be found on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/flammia_s_1.html) and on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-VnX0xYAAAAJ).
