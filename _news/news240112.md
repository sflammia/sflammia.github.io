###### I'm moving! 

I'm pleased to announce that I've moved back to acedemia as a Professor in the Computer Science department at Virginia Tech. I will be the Director of a new quantum theory center at the [Innovation Campus](https://www.vt.edu/innovationcampus/index.html) in Alexandria, VA, just outside of Washington, DC. The new building will be finished at the end of this year, and we will be hiring 4â€“5 theory faculty as well as postdocs and graduate students, so send me your CV if you're interested.
